# Leaflet Challenge

## Task
To build a set of tools that will assist with the visualisation of earthquake data for the United States Geological Survey (USGS).  The visualisations should be informative and accessible in order to educate the public and government organisations on issues facing the planet.

## Part 1
This task provides a basic visualisation of the earthquake data set. It displays the earthquakes as circular data markers that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and colour. Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked. A legend is also included to provide context for the map data.

## Part 2
This task provides a visualisation where a number of base map styles can be selected and two different data sets are used to make overlays which can be switched on and off independently. One overlay displays earthquake data as in Leaflet Step 1. The second overlay displays data on tectonic plates. The inclusion of the two data sets aims to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
